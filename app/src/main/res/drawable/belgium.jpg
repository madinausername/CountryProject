# From Paul Eggert (2003-03-23):
# We don't know the date of that quote, but we'll guess they
# started DST on June 3.  Possibly DST was observed other years

# Nauru

# From Phake Nick (2018-10-31):
# Currently, the tz database say Nauru use LMT until 1921, and then
# switched to GMT+11:30 for the next two decades.
# However, a number of timezone map published in America/Japan back then
# showed its timezone as GMT+11 per https://wiki.suikawiki.org/n/ナウルの標準時
# And it would also be nice if the 1921 transition date could be sourced.

# based on "Nauru Standard Time Act 1978 Time Change"
# http://www.paclii.org/nr/legis/num_act/nsta1978207/ defined that "Nauru
# Alternative Time" (GMT+12) should be in effect from 1979 Feb.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2018-11-19):
# The 1921-01-15 introduction of standard time is in Shanks; it is also in
# "Standard Time Throughout the World", US National Bureau of Standards (1935),
# page 3, which does not give the UT offset.  In response to a comment by
# Phake Nick I set the Nauru time of occupation by Japan to
# 1942-08-29/1945-09-08 by using dates from:

# From Paul Eggert (2019-08-28):
# Transitions before 2015 are from timeanddate.com, which consulted
# the Norfolk Island Museum and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's
# Norfolk Island station, and found no record of Norfolk observing DST
# other than in 1974/5.  See:
# https://www.timeanddate.com/time/australia/norfolk-island.html
# However, disagree with timeanddate about the 1975-03-02 transition;
# timeanddate has 02:00 but 02:00s corresponds to what the NSW law said
# (thanks to Michael Deckers).

# Norfolk started observing Australian DST in spring 2019.

# Pitcairn

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# A Proclamation was signed by the Governor of Pitcairn on the 27th March 1998
# with regard to Pitcairn Standard Time.  The Proclamation is as follows.
#
#	The local time for general purposes in the Islands shall be
#	Co-ordinated Universal time minus 8 hours and shall be known
#	as Pitcairn Standard Time.
#
# ... I have also seen Pitcairn listed as UTC minus 9 hours in several
# references, and can only assume that this was an error in interpretation
# somehow in light of this proclamation.

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-09):
# The Proclamation regarding Pitcairn time came into effect on 27 April 1998
# ... at midnight.

# From Howie Phelps (1999-11-10), who talked to a Pitcairner via shortwave:
# Betty Christian told me yesterday that their local time is the same as
# Pacific Standard Time. They used to be ½ hour different from us here in
# Sacramento but it was changed a couple of years ago.


# (Western) Samoa and American Samoa

# Howse writes (p 153) that after the 1879 standardization on Antipodean
# time by the British governor of Fiji, the King of Samoa decided to change
# "the date in his kingdom from the Antipodean to the American system,
# ordaining - by a masterpiece of diplomatic flattery - that
# the Fourth of July should be celebrated twice in that year."
# This happened in 1892, according to the Evening News (Sydney) of 1892-07-20.
# https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/idl/idl.htm

# Although Shanks & Pottenger says they both switched to UT -11:30
# in 1911, and to -11 in 1950. many earlier sources give -11
# for American Samoa, e.g., the US National Bureau of Standards
# circular "Standard Time Throughout the World", 1932.
# Assume American Samoa switched to -11 in 1911, not 1950,
# and that after 1950 they agreed until (western) Samoa skipped a
# day in 2011.  Assume also that the Samoas follow the US and New
# Zealand's "ST"/"DT" style of daylight-saving abbreviations.


# Tonga

# From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):
# Today's _Wall Street Journal_ (p 1) reports that "Tonga has been plotting
# to sneak ahead of [New Zealanders] by introducing daylight-saving time."
# Since Kiribati has moved the Date Line it's not clear what Tonga will do.

# Don Mundell writes in the 1997-02-20 Tonga Chronicle
# How Tonga became 'The Land where Time Begins':
# http://www.tongatapu.net.to/tonga/homeland/timebegins.htm
#
# Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
# 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
# standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its
